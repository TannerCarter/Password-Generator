# Password Generator

# Description

In this weeks challenge of using Javascript, we were tasked with creating a functioning password generator that writes to the page. The hardest part of this project was figuring out the user inputs to function correctly. Once the bugs were fixed, the sails were set and we were ready for take off.

# Tasks

When clicking the button to generate a password. <br>
A series of prompts for password criteria would popup. <br>
The prompts indicated what would be included in the generated password as well as the length. <br>
The length of the password needed to be at least 8 to 128 characters. <br>
The characters prompted for are lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. <br>
When prompts are answered. <br>
Then a validation occurs to ensure at least one character type is selected. <br>
When all prompts are answered. <br>
The generated password will be parsed to the page.
